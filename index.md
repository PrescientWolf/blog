# For Cyber Threat Intelligence Program Builds
## Mission
* Equipping the right people, with the right information at the right time.

## Rules of Thumb
* Know the enemy
* No jerks, no whiners, no peacocks. 
* NSTR is OK. Don't create something from nothing. Don't be afraid to say 'I don't know' or 'it's not there.' 
* TL;DR in intelligence is the BLUF, not the bluff. 
* Omit needless words. (e.g. "due to the fact that," "problematic," "very").
* Use active voice.
* Clarity of expression + command of the subject matter = confidence.
* Aim small, miss small. Scope properly.
* Make sure intelligence is Complete Accurate Relevant & Timely (CART). This is actionable, high-impact intelligence. Clarify, don't add noise. 
* Be brief, be bright, be gone.
* In report writing, know your audience. For some, turn tradecraft knowledge into a story. For others, bulleted BLUF with ability to drill-down.
* Smooth seas don't skillful sailors make.
