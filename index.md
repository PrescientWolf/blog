# Decision Intelligence
## Mission
* Inspire leaders and decision-makers around the world to be honest about their mental assumptions, learn how to make sense of new/old information and apply useful techniques to their decision-making processes.The idea of making better decisions is not new. Everyone makes decisions, either explicitly or implicitly. But it is increasingly a topic of interest because of how many psychological and technological advances have been made in recent years (e.g. fMRI, ML, etc.) and how those same advancements can improve human ability to improve outcomes. For almost anyone willing to listen and learn, decisions can improve not only in type but in frequency. Even if outcomes do not happen as planned, good decisions increase the likelihood of them happening. 
The question is, what will you CHOOSE? â€ƒ
